# (WIP) React-TypeScript-Boilerplate

This is my attempt at a boilerplate still WIP. **Use at your own peril.**

## WARNING!

Included some css with dark/light theming, might remove it since you don't want to remove it every time you start a new project. Still thinking what is better a full color theme where you can change the colors or keep it as empty as possible. Right now I'm leaning to option one.

## TODO (subject to change)

- [x] Dev server
- [x] Hello World
- [x] scss modules and imports
- [ ] Update webpack to v5
- [ ] Improve webpack build production script
- [ ] GitHub Pages deploy script
- [ ] Cypress testing
- [ ] add some modules
  - [ ] Navbar
  - [ ] Buttons
    - [ ] Standard button
    - [ ] icon button
  - [ ] table
  - [ ] modal
- [ ] Full color theming or remove it
